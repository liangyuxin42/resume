  Hi, my name is Liang Yuxin. I am a master's student in computer science from Northwestern University. 
  My research interests in <mark>natural language processing</mark> and <mark>representation learning</mark>. 
  
  
  During my master's study, I was introduced to and fascinated by the rich and exciting field of natural language processing. 
  My research work centers around text representation learning (some of which has been published). 
  In this process I have also acquired some essential skills, including literature searching and reading, programming (mainly in python and pytorch), and the ability to communicate with people in depth about academic subjects. 
  
  I hope to continue the fascinating and challenging research journey during my PhD!

          * Geometric property correction of pre-trained language model word embeddings, making the embedding more isotropic by removing the dominant directions
          * Contrastive learning using pre-trained language models to improve the performance of text encoders, focusing primarily on unsupervised contrastive learning without negative samples
          * Text classification using different loss functions to adjust the geometry of the text embedding
